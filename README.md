# 📊 Java Graph Algorithm Solver

A Java-based project that allows users to create and manipulate graphs (weighted or unweighted), and run various graph traversal and shortest path algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford.

This project is ideal for educational purposes, algorithm visualization, and understanding graph data structures.

## 🌟 Features

* ✅ Create **weighted or unweighted** directed graphs.
* ➕ Add and remove edges interactively.
* ✏️ Edit the weight/value of existing edges.
* 🔍 Run the following algorithms:

  * **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  * **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  * **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path**
  * **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
* 🖥️ Simple command-line interface or GUI (if implemented).
* 📄 Logs or displays step-by-step algorithm execution.

## 🧠 Algorithms Explained

* **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Explores nodes level-by-level; great for unweighted shortest paths and connectivity checks.
* **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores deeply before backtracking; useful for detecting cycles or connected components.
* **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Efficient for finding the shortest path in **weighted** graphs with **non-negative** edge weights.
* **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Works even with **negative weights**, and detects **negative weight cycles**.


## 📈 Example Use Cases

* Learn how different graph algorithms work.
* Create and test custom graphs manually.
* Compare algorithm outputs for correctness and performance.
